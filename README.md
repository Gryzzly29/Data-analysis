# Data-analysis

My name is Erick and im looking to change my career path from systems engineer to data analysis, so im creating this hub to practise my skills for data analysis and so the recruiters can see what i can do :)
Hope this info is relevant to someone and can help me land a new job, will try updating it at leas every 2 weeks with new project just to show what i have been learning.
So far i have done the Google Data analystics Certificate on Corusera and i have added that to my linked in profile, this course teaches you basics about data analytics, it also includes some basic/intermediate
knowledge on Google sheets, Excel, Tableau, and R for data analysis.
